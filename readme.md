# file-downloader-script

A simple script for `mass uploading` and `rename` files using links from a `csv` file. 

Based on **Node.js** and **Vanilla JS**

Made for those who are just starting their journey with a **Node.js** or have not heard about it at all and just want to download a bunch of files using links from a file.

## Components

- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- ⚡️[csv-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parser) 
- [nodejs-file-downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-file-downloader) 

- [Readable Streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)

Events available on Node built-in

## Usage

Install and setting script. 
Prepare the csv file in the **required format**.
U can upload example file .csv and use it.
But it contains unnecessary columns, for my purposes, you can simplify it and the script itself. Check comments.
